978-9730-228236:Mihalcea, Vlad:English:High-Performance Java Persistence:A high-performance data access layer must resonate with the underlying database system. Knowing the inner workings of a relational database and the data access frameworks in use can make the difference between a high-performance enterprise application and one that barely crawls.This book is a journey into Java data access performance tuning. From connection management, to batch updates, fetch sizes and concurrency control mechanisms, it unravels the inner workings of the most common Java data access frameworks.The first part aims to reduce the gap between application developers and database administrators. For this reason, it covers both JDBC and the database fundamentals that are of paramount importance when reducing transaction response times. In this first part, you'll learn about connection management, batch updates, statement caching, result set fetching and database transactions.The second part demonstrates how you can take advantage of JPA and Hibernate without compromising application performance. In this second part, you'll learn about the most efficient Hibernate mappings (basic types, associations, inheritance), fetching best practices, caching and concurrency control mechanisms.The third part is dedicated to jOOQ and its powerful type-safe querying capabilities, like window functions, common table expressions, upsert, stored procedures and database functions.
